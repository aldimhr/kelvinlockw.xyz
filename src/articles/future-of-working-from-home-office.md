  description: Taking a programmatic approach to help employees split their time between home and the office
published: true

I recently advised a local Public Relations company on their plans to reopen their offices. They, like many others, see the future of work as a blend of home and office working.

I suspect many companies will initially approach this by splitting employees' time between working at home and working in the office, perhaps 50 / 50, or 40 / 60.

However, if they don't put some safeguards in place they’re likely to run into some unintended consequences that will have an impact on productivity. Many of these will be specific to individual circumstances but I believe there are a few that will be much more generally applicable.

Firstly, I can foresee problems with employees not being present in the office at the same time, missing out on important interactions. If every employee has full control over when they spend their allotted days in the office it becomes a lottery as to whether their days in the office coincide with those of their colleagues. It is important to remember that as the percentage of time spent working in the office decreases, the likelihood of completely missing another colleague during the working week increases by a magnitude.

The second problem is context switching. Employees are likely to discover different working rhythms for each environment in which they work. Experts discuss deep versus shallow work, and most people will find that each environment they work in to be like a magnet, pulling them towards certain forms of work. Zigzagging between home and office is probably not a good idea for most people due to the high cost of context switching. Consecutive days spent in the same working environment / context are more likely to boost productivity.

By putting in place safeguards, employers can increase the probability of calendar collision, ensuring that employees time spent in the office involves colleagues and is more meaningful.

Ultimately the safeguards can be rules that are programmed into a system that would direct each employee's calendar. These rules may include any of the following:

- Mandatory Mondays - every working Monday must be office based, the only exception is public holidays and when booked holiday includes a Monday.

- Minimum 50% office based - 50% of Tuesday to Friday working days must be office based, this doesn’t mean that 50% is working from home because booked holidays will be accounted for within this half of the equation.

- No single arbitrary days - both the office based days and working from home days must be accompanied with at least a consecutive day of the same status.
 
When you start layering these rules together a pattern is codified which continually applies the safeguards to employees calendars and therefore helps the organisation to avoid the unintended consequences.

Since the pattern of rules are calendar-driven, it simplifies employees' scheduling-lives by giving them less to think about. They just need to keep their - working from home / working from the office - status updated 7 or 14 days ahead of time.

The parameters are fully adjustable, for example numbers could be changed based on seasonal fluctuations or even [covid alert levels](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-covid-19-alert-level-methodology-an-overview/uk-covid-19-alert-level-methodology-an-overview).

Some of these rules complement each other; for example, ‘Mandatory Monday’ and ‘No single arbitrary days’ require employees to pair Friday with Monday, or Monday with Tuesday, as office-based days. As a result, context switching is being minimised.

Of course there is no one-size-fits-all solution. When approaching this problem within your organisation consider the strengths and weaknesses of your workplace, bear in mind who needs regular interaction with who, and have some goals and principles in mind.

The takeaway here is that an inclusive and fair calendar solution can be programmed. Using simple math, logic and rules you can design a formula for employees that is structured, rolling, self-manageable and updatable.
