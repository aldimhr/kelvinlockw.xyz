Rather than dwell on this phenomenon I‚Äôll point you at Josh Topolsky‚Äôs [brief history lesson](https://medium.com/@joshuatopolsky/your-media-business-will-not-be-saved-1b0716b5010c) if you‚Äôd like to understand how this demise came about.

Thankfully there‚Äôs been a response. We‚Äôve seen a groundswell of entrepreneurial endeavours attempting to fill the news publishing voids, which in part has come about because it‚Äôs easier to publish online than ever before.

However, the state of affairs in local journalism is particularly thin on the ground. In the US it‚Äôs been characterised as [‚Äònews deserts‚Äô](https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american-news-deserts-donuts-local.php) in an effort to paint a picture of the closures and job destruction, whilst in the UK the former Head of BBC News describes a [‚Äúdemocratic deficit‚Äù](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/future-of-news).

On the positive side, the regeneration of local journalism has been documented by [work at the Reynolds Institute](http://www.micheleslist.org/) who record the emergence of a new generation of local news publishers. Further evidence can be found in the membership growth of [Local Independent Online News Publishers](https://lionpublishers.com/).

We can‚Äôt be certain to what degree this vacuum effect will address the speed & scale of the news deserts problem. If we consider market forces, we can assume the answer to this question will be driven by the size of the opportunity, which of course has been contracting since the evolution of the internet.

For a while digital ads were the saviour, news publishers became addicted to digital ad revenue but Facebook and Google have now eaten their lunch, gobbling up more than [60% of the pie](https://www.raconteur.net/marketing/google-facebook-duopoly/), causing irrevocable damage to the business models that fund journalism. Publishers are now focusing on reader revenue (subscriptions, memberships etc) but nobody wants to have too many subscription services so it looks like there will be a few winners and a long tail of losers, and [this scenario won‚Äôt play out well](https://digiday.com/media/digiday-podcast-ken-doctor-higher-quality-legacy-publications-can-get-people-pay/) for the fortunes of local journalism.

This business-model-conundrum collides with the reality that journalists are seeking to ply their trade with more agency and autonomy than ever before, which fits into both the ‚Äòfuture of work‚Äô and ‚Äòcreator economy‚Äô trends.

To explore this collision I‚Äôm going to contrast the opportunity to be a journalist with the opportunity to drive for Uber, through the lens of market forces‚Ä¶

Imagine a world with an exponential number of Uber drivers yet no dedicated app for ride hailers to access them‚Ä¶ in reality we know that this growth of drivers wouldn‚Äôt occur because nobody would choose to take on the Uber driver occupation. This scenario explains why drivers need a way to have a direct relationship with ride hailers, hence the Uber app which creates the demand for drivers to supply.

So in a world where the Uber app enables drivers to have a direct relationship with ride hailers, what will enable journalists to have a direct relationship with readers? What is the interface and system that creates demand for journalists to supply? The internet doesn‚Äôt resolve this on its own - as with Uber a radical new solution is required to answer these questions.

The cost of producing news has been undermined, not just by the [monopolistic Facebook / Google duopoly](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/us-presidential-hopeful-bernie-sanders-criticises-duopoly-facebook-google-for-siphoning-off-ad-revenues/), other digital forces have converged, namely [democratisation](https://theconversation.com/democratising-journalism-should-we-have-more-of-it-in-australia-19487), [fragmentation](https://www.zeit.de/kultur/2018-08/jay-rosen-washington-post-jeff-bezos-donald-trump-journalism-right-wing-populism/seite-4) and [homogenisation](https://medium.com/global-editors-network/fixing-the-news-by-rating-stories-7c971116d2ef). Before we can imagine a healthy and prosperous news economy, it must pay to do journalism, the currency of journalists' work ‚Äî digital content - has to be monetised. Remuneration must be baked into any future system, because money makes the world go round!

Fortunately we‚Äôre now moving into the third generation of the internet where monetisation and direct relationships can be part of the same infrastructure. Having gone down the blockchain-rabbit-hole I know that it‚Äôs quite possible for the future of journalism to be underpinned by decentralised infrastructure - such as [Ethereum](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/about-ethereum-eth/).

[Trent McConaghy](http://trent.st/) describes blockchains as [Incentive Machines](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/can-blockchains-go-rogue-5134300ce790). Why does this matter? Because an incentive machine can become a job creation machine, and with a job creation machine we can maximise journalism‚Äôs opportunity.

If we think back to the Uber analogy we can begin to imagine how much opportunity could be unlocked; when Uber joined the market their new way of doing things didn‚Äôt just capture some market share, it profoundly grew the size of the market.

With this determination I can see a future with a dedicated mobile app for production and consumption of news, and behind it a system without rent-seeking intermediaries, which respects privacy, and where real value is exchanged in an autonomous way.

In essence this is journalism meeting the future of work. When we create opportunities for out-of-work journalists to get back to their vocation, together with having a stake in their own future, the regeneration of journalism will be in full flow.

The more things change, the more they stay the same! To wrap up this article I‚Äôd like to reintroduce an idea that has been around for ten years. In 2009, Alan Rusbridger, the former editor-in-chief of The Guardian, outlined his vision for a [Mutualised Newspaper](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/report-mutualisation-citizen-journalism). It was an imaginative way to discuss the impact the second generation of the internet (also known as Web 2.0 or the Social Web) would have on the craft of journalism and advocate for an open and collaborative future.

> He said: ‚ÄúWe have to get over this journalistic arrogance that journalists are the only people who are the figures of authority in the world‚Äù.

Amazingly, Alan‚Äôs vision is even more relevant now than it was 10 years ago and corresponds nicely with the ideas explored in this article.

I believe it will be the principles of Mutualisation, combined with the capabilities of financial infrastructure that provides us with a collective direction to the promised land. In conclusion, the infrastructure of the second generation of the internet helped you publish your work, and the financial infrastructure of the imminent third generation of the internet - blockchain technology - will help your published work get directly monetised.

Now we can all be stewards of the information economy!
