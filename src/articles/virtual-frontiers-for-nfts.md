  description: The virtual economy refers to all of the economic activity that occurs in virtual worlds where the jobs, assets, marketplaces and trading have real monetary value.
---
There could be as many as 2.5 billion people participating in some way on the platforms which comprise the virtual economy. Not only do they spend their time socialising and playing, many earn and spend real money on virtual items and virtual labour and trade these assets on online marketplaces.

The virtual economy encompasses a range of online communities including online multiplayer games for example Minecraft and Fallout, and virtual worlds such as [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [SecondLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life).

Most multiplayer games (MMOs) have their own digital currencies and items such as weapons, clothes, accessories and furniture, which can either be found natively within games or purchased from the games internal marketplace. The origins of MMOs and virtual goods can be traced back beyond World of Warcraft. Today MMOs account for 25%, and growing, of the global gaming market that was estimated to be worth $162 billion in 2020.

Within the virtual economy, there are numerous spheres of activity, supporting a diverse range of jobs, generating at least $66 billion income according to research by [L’Atelier](https://atelier.net/virtual-economy/).

Earnings can run into the millions in some cases, such as professional gamers where the esports industry has seen so much investment and growth that world's largest traditional sports teams have become major stakeholders.

In Venezuela, people make a living and counter their nation’s economic woes by “Gold farming”, an activity that describes people obtaining in-game currency with the purpose of selling it for “real-world” money. And in The Philippines, where government support during the pandemic has been harder to come by, people are playing [Axie Infinity](https://leofinance.io/@knowhow92/passive-income-with-blockchain-gaming-part-1-axie-infinity) where they compete for “Small Love Potions,” or SLP, which can be sold for cryptocurrency or used to breed more Axies.

People from all walks of life will benefit from the virtual economy. Artists are making and selling virtual art, musicians are performing [virtual gigs](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/virtual-music-festival-minecraft-video-game-1003205/) to audiences of millions, and entrepreneurs are setting up shop fronts in virtual worlds like Decentraland.

Unlike Second Life, Decentraland is entirely controlled by a decentralized set of actors. The virtual space is developed on the Ethereum blockchain with MANA, the platform's native crypto token, used to purchase land parcels. Each plot of land is unique, and the owners can choose what they want to fill it with. This can include anything from an immersive scene to an interactive game. Decentraland’s economics are enabled by [MANA](https://republic.co/blog/real-estate/investing-in-decentraland-in-2021), a fungible ERC-20 token that can be used to claim LAND, a non-fungible ERC-721 token (also known as a NFT) that represents the unique land parcel. It’s a little perplexing, but it’s common to find games and worlds that have designed their rewards and incentives around several tokens.

Over the last month Decentraland has seen more than $8 million in total sales. This includes land parcels, avatars, usernames and wearables like virtual outfits, purchased for development or speculation.

What draws many of these people to the virtual economy is the fact that the only barrier to entry is having the intellect and ability to see the opportunities and to play along. It makes no difference where you are, if you’re young, old, a man or a woman, or whether you have a degree or not - virtual economies represent viable and sometimes lucrative opportunities for supplemental income, whoever you are.

The virtual economy will become more important as people devote more of their professional and personal lives to virtual environments. The overall pie will grow, more industries will get involved, and no doubt there will be openings for mainstream brands to participate and reach new audiences.

With this economic activity being largely unregulated and playing such an important role in so many people’s lives, there is no doubt that the premise of blockchain technology will have a significant impact on the maturity of the virtual economy. 

The Metaverse is a term often used in the blockchain / crypto / web3 communities to describe a collective space - the sum of all virtual worlds. The expectation is that you’ll be able to take your digital possessions from one world into another, and you’ll also be free to trade them on secondary marketplaces. This is why unique digital items, spawned as NFTs and permanently etched on blockchains, matter, their value is not produced in isolation. The authority, immutability, and transferability of NFTs will become increasingly important as virtual worlds grow, mature, and converge.

Going forward, the open, permissionless existence of the virtual worlds being built out on blockchain technology will hold a distinct allure for participants. The opportunity to invest time and money, and then ‘cash out’, will become indelible. This freedom is enticing when contrasted with the control exerted by the publishers behind games like Fortnite and Animal Crossing who prohibit selling in-game assets outside of the game. These publishers capture value with their in-game currencies so players are unable to ‘cash out’ for real money - money enters, but cannot leave.

When we connect the dots from the emergent activity in these virtual worlds to the trading and programmability of NFTs, as well as their potential and [endless possibilities](https://medium.com/charged-particles/possibility-for-unlimited-creativity-with-charged-particles-c2f044883f73), we begin to see many opportunities on the virtual-economy-horizon. 

By the end of this decade, technological advancements in areas such as Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Wearables, and the Internet of Things, will intersect with virtual worlds to unlock new economic opportunities. Newfound experiences and growing virtual populations could be transformative to society and culture; and this will drive further growth of the virtual economy.
