The current state of monetisation in podcasting mirrors the early internet - money lags behind attention.

Much like early web pages there was no money to be made in podcasts at first, because no one was creating podcasts with the goal of making money. People made podcasts because there was something in the world they found interesting and they had a hunch that someone out there might find it interesting too.

Until recently, monetisation efforts have been limited primarily to in-show advertising, merchandising, and crowdfunding via third-party platforms like patreon.

New hardware including AirPods, connected cars, and smart speakers has made it much easier for people to listen to audio content, and with more bandwidth and opportunities to listen, podcast creators operate in a market that continues to boom. However, as already mentioned podcasters' financial opportunities lag behind and have yet to mature.

Historically, Apple’s core business has been selling hardware - Mac computers, iPods and iPhones - so until recently they took a relatively hands-off approach to content mediums like podcasting. Their first major foray came in 2005 when Steve Jobs unveiled the integration of podcasting into its iTunes music software, calling podcasting “TiVo for radio.”

By introducing features and functionality to help people find and add podcast feeds, the iTunes transformation made it easier for people to access and organise podcasts. New episodes would be automatically downloaded when they were released, thanks to RSS, a web syndication technology first released in 1999.

Many listeners encountered podcasting for the first time when Apple installed the distinctive purple Apple Podcasts app by default on iPhones in late 2014, accelerating audience growth for podcasters. Since then there has been a proliferation of podcast apps to discover and listen to podcasts. Despite this, Apple Podcasts remains the largest podcast directory, both serving as a portal to hundreds of thousands of new podcasts, and an archive by preserving the feeds of shows that no longer publish new episodes.

The podcasting medium - made possible by open source RSS technology - emerged organically, thanks in part to its free and open architecture and lack of big tech gatekeepers.

For a long time, it has seemed inevitable that the podcasting infrastructure would have paywall mechanisms incorporated to directly monetise audiences. We now live in a world where we’ve been conditioned to pay for subscription services such as New York Times, Netflix and Amazon Prime. This paradigm has been bred into content platforms, which have baked monetisation into distribution so that creators on their platforms have a clear way to make money. We've seen Twitch membership tiers, YouTube's Join button, and more recently Twitter introducing TipJar and Super Follow as ways for creators to collect donations and subscriptions directly on the platform.

Podcasting largely remained free from the whims of big tech until Spotify exhibited its ambitions in 2019, [acquiring Gimlet Media and Anchor FM](https://stratechery.com/2019/spotifys-podcast-aggregation-play/). The threat posed by Spotify has compelled Apple to act. Apple has always had the capability and scale to go much deeper in terms of podcast monetisation, but resisted until April of this year, when it reaffirmed its commitment to podcasting by announcing paid subscriptions through its Apple Podcasts service. Podcasters will now be able to charge listeners to access their content on Apple’s platform, with Apple taking 30% of the proceeds. Apple is no longer satisfied with simply growing the number of podcast listeners; it has developed the technical infrastructure so that podcasters can turn on subscription paywalls, and therefore it can take a slice of the subscription-revenue-pie.

Apple will also be storing podcast recordings on its own servers for the first time, making it a first-party podcast host and potentially taking some business from third-party podcast hosting services such as Transistor, Podbean, and Libsyn.

Spotify has responded with its own array of monetisation tools to level the playing field and provide genuine competitive choice to podcasters.

While this platform envelopment is a far cry from the principles that podcasting was founded on, the battle between Spotify and Apple has ushered in a range of tools and opportunities for podcasters to monetise their work. The big tech clouds have gathered and it's the podcasters who have found the silver lining; they are more empowered than ever before, with the gaps between creating, publishing and monetising content being as tight as they have ever been.

By incorporating an AI-assisted editing tool, such as [Descript](https://www.descript.com/), into the podcaster’s workflow, podcasting becomes technically the most seamless platform for an individual to make a living from their own content production.

The opportunity to become a paid podcaster will entice a whole generation of influencers. People who rose to prominence on platforms like Instagram by taking photos and posting them to the world, will dedicate more of their time to podcasting, where the audio opportunity has become much more obvious and seamless.

Podcast listeners who intentionally subscribe are far more likely to return to shows over and over again, this reality contributes to a “stronger base” from which podcasters can potentially monetise. YouTubers, frustrated by [YouTube’s algorithm](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-the-youtube-algorithm-works/) having control over the distribution of their videos, will turn to podcasts to free themselves, and to forge more direct relationships with their audiences. 

Apple and Spotify have upped the ante, and more people will move into the podcasting space, but it's important to remember that this raises the bar on quality. Because podcast shows will have to be richer, more immersive, more polished, the market for [production studios](https://podcastlabs.co.uk/) will grow. And, as the emphasis shifts to listener revenue, advertising slots and brand partnerships will need to evolve to be more relevant, interesting and thoughtful than those that have come before.
