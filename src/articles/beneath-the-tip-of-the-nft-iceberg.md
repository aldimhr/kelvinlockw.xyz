  description: NFTs have risen to prominence, but it's just the tip of the iceberg!

The entire market capitalisation of cryptocurrency is now greater than $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has become the 6th largest currency in the world with more money in circulation than the British pound sterling.

With so much capital - monetary and intellectual - being invested in the crypto space there's a lot at stake which in turn attracts an overwhelming amount of information, maximalism and hyperbole. And for those uninterested in the ‘stocks and shares’ aspect it can be particularly off putting.

If you scratch beneath the surface you’ll see that the bitcoin blockchain has no central authority, its decentralisation, permanence and security make the bitcoin cryptocurrency possible. So at its core, blockchain technology enables things that weren’t possible before.

Go further down the ‘rabbit hole’, you’ll learn about many potential uses for blockchain technology and you can begin to imagine new products, services and solutions to problems we previously took for granted. As a product person this is where my main interest lies. I personally spent a long time down the ‘rabbit hole’ (around the time of the Initial Coin Offering frenzy in 2017) and it became clear to me that the broad utility of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with their ownership attributes having merit in the wider world, would take crypto-enablement closer to mainstream adoption. 

I recommend heading to OpenSea’s well-written [primer on NFTs](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) to familiarise yourself with the finer details.

Simply put, NFTs are unique digital tokens that are issued, recorded and managed on a blockchain. These tokens usually refer to one-of-a-kind digital or physical assets. Given that they are simply digital representations of ownership, NFTs will be utilised in many different industries but for now we’re witnessing the first wave of adoption in the arts and gaming.

Artists are issuing tokenized representations of their work, capturing their provenance, and making their creations available on global art marketplaces. In a similar vein, game developers can now create digital goods or in-game assets - represented as NFTs - that maintain value beyond the game or virtual world they were conceived in.

NFTs can also represent physical assets such as real estate or camping tents. Just before the pandemic I worked with Rob Secord (of Charged Particles, read on to learn more!) on [Rent My Tent](https://github.com/Rent-My-Tent/Rent-My-Tent), a rental marketplace concept. The ambition for Rent My Tent is to drive down the need to manufacture new tents and therefore reduce the amount of tents going into landfill.

I realised we could achieve more reuse of tents by programming incentives into the physical tent, via an NFT that represents it.

Once a tent owner lists their idle tent, the online marketplace takes control of the destiny of the tent, matching its availability with demand from anyone needing to hire a tent. What sets this apart from a typical online marketplace transaction is the deposit that gets attached to the tents NFT, providing it with the same kind of incentive as a deposit return scheme. 
Fundamentally, the tent remains in circulation because it’s always up for hire and the hirer who takes possession of the tent is incentivised to take good care of it until the next hirer comes along.

Don’t get overwhelmed by the tents here. What matters is that NFTs promise far more than just being digital representations of ownership. Rent My Tent is an example of how NFTs can be extended to enable new forms of access and exchange. When you hold this thought and then consider all of our possessions that are under utilised, as well as the allocative efficiency of market dynamics, you’ll begin to see a new paradigm for circular economies!

I explained the relevance of bitcoin to set the scene for this article but it's the significance of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) that empowers these new frontiers. Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a blockchain with its own native cryptocurrency. Ethereum has roughly 20% share of the cryptocurrency market. Importantly, Ethereum embraced smart contracts (an idea that predates blockchain), and this paradigm offers software developers the programmability to write and deploy code that runs autonomously. This freedom allows anyone to issue, own and trade cryptocurrency (fungible tokens) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on Ethereum’s public network.

Now you might be wondering if Ethereum offers the ‘best technology’, or if you’ve already done some homework you may have read about technical scaling challenges and encountered some cumbersome user experiences. It's important for product builders not to become fixated on this, the technology with the best merits on paper won’t necessarily win out.

Communities have formed around cryptocurrencies, bringing influence and network effects that give them competitive advantages which then become somewhat self-reinforcing.

To put this into a higher-order mental model - generally applicable to the entire crypto ecosystem - I’d like to introduce you to something that MetaKovan described beautifully during an [interview with Jason Calacanis](https://youtu.be/kHXIn-nq90A?t=995).

He said Religion comes first, then Economics and then the Technology!

While he cautions that “every analogy is a little wrong,” this hierarchy, with technology at the bottom, tells us that there is so much more to public blockchains, and brings into focus the outsized influence that communities (and their [super influencers](https://www.profgalloway.com/the-martian/)) have on the trajectory and impact of cryptocurrencies.

Religion means fervent believers (not only token holders, but everyone involved with the wider crypto community) and Economics is the confidence in deploying capital (becoming a token holder), and many of these people are the same, therefore the level of self-reinforcement runs deep. MetaKovan understood this when he paid $69.3 million for [Everydays: the First 5000 Days](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924), he was not only placing an astronomical value on the art work; he was also signalling its cultural significance, recognising that his commitment would be self-reinforcing. Not just a headline-grabbing move, but a watershed moment that will accelerate the prevalence of NFTs and play out well for his ambitions in the longer term.

Product builders should tread carefully when assessing the merits of Ethereum’s rivals, who often lay claim to faster and cheaper transactions. Ethereum's momentum, diversity, and the pace at which innovation is being developed on the network should not be underestimated. It has built tremendous ecosystem support for critical components such as digital wallets, exchanges and payment gateways, as well as regulatory affinity.

Ethereum isn’t the only public blockchain offering smart contracts but it is where most NFT activity has taken place to date. The Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and NFT paradigms happened first on Ethereum for a reason. Whether you’re building a new product or seeking new opportunities, your chances of success are somewhat aligned with those who have gone before you, they have prepared the building blocks and often they win if you win. When considering Ethereum’s potential, with its extensibility, its convergence of DeFi legos and NFTs; keep MetaKovan’s analogy in mind.

Since Ethereum has the greatest developer mindshare and the most mature building blocks, new product builders are only limited by their creativity! [Charged Particles](https://charged.fi/) is one of these creative building blocks, bridging DeFi and NFTs. The Charged Particles protocol enables all sorts of digital and physical assets, rights, revenue streams, incentives, and rules of engagement, to be programmed into an NFT. This will fuel an abundance of novel access, ownership and transferability use cases that just weren’t previously achievable. Or as Mark Cuban puts it [“Things that don’t have a way to be monetised right now can be monetised”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC2mRiNmyms). Strap in for the Charge!
